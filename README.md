## Overview

TODO: Describe the project

## Setup

To run the application, clone the project to a local directory and execute the following:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

This will initialise the Expo Devtools from which the application can be connected to either local Android or iOS simulators. For more information about the Expo CLI, please see this [blog post](https://blog.expo.io/expo-cli-2-0-released-a7a9c250e99c)
